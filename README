README for DataScienceatScale_Assignment3

-------------------------------------------
Assignment 3 for the Data Manipulation at Scale: Systems and Algorithms course, which is a part of the Data Science at Scale Coursera Specialization

Implementing MapReduce algorithms in a Python framework
-------------------------------------------

MapReduce.py: the MapReduce class definition allowing us to simulate an MR job.

inverted_index.py: mapper and reducer functions for building an inverted index. Given a set of documents, an inverted index is a dictionary where each word is associated with a list of the document identifiers in which that word appears.

join.py: implements a relational join as a MR query

friend_count.py: a MapReduce algorithm for counting the number of friends a person has

asymmetric_friendships.py: an MR algorithm to check if a given relationship is one-directional, i.e. B is a friend of A, but A is not a friend of B. 

unique_trims.py: trims a set of DNA sequences and outputs the unique resulting sequences

multiply.py: a MapReduce algorithm for computing sparse matrix multiplication

data/: a folder containing JSON files used as input for each of the 6 algorithms described above

solutions/: a folder containing JSON files with the reducer output we should obtain by running the algorithms on the input data
